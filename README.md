# dart-checkout
determine a winning throw of 501

The current solution is extremely naive and could benefit from improvements.
One improvement is that the solution given might not be the most "favourable"
    - e.g. a more favourable throw would be D5 to checkout 10, instead this solution gives 8 and D1
